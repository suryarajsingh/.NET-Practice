Collections : 

HashTable - stores info as key value pairs ( key- identifier, value is data)
keys can be of some data type and values can be of other datatypes
It uses a hashing technique to sort and store data- which is neither the inserted order nor sorted order.
Efficient for search operations. 
Keys have to be unique and not null
values can be duplicated or can have null 

Sorted List - is a key value pair collection
Keys and values can be of different datatypes
The data is sorted on the keys

Stacks : Last in First Out - LIFO / First in Last Out - FILO

Queues : Fist in First out - FIFO

Generics : is a way to let us define type-safe classes/methods/properties without compromising
  type safety
  performance
  productivity
   allows to create class/methods decoupled with the datatype
   Retrieval of fifferent datatypes becomes difficult requiring typecast, but with generics we can organize and retrieve data efficiently
 
ArrayList   -    List
HashTable   -    Dictionary


Delegate : are similar to function pointers of C,C++, that points to a particular. 
 are refrence types that holds the reference to a method/function. The reference can be changed at   runtime.
Are specially used for implementing events and call backs methods
A delegate object can refer to a method whose signature matches as that of the delegate

Multicast delegates : one delegate object pointing to many functions

Lambdas: 

int c= a+b;

int c=add(5,10);
int add(int a, int b)
{
return a +bl
}

The method takes up time to load into the callstack, substitute the parameters, hence the performance can slow down

The simpler tasks done thru methods can be replaced using lambda expressions

LINQ - Lang. Integrated Query - a uniform query syntax to retrieve data from different sources and formats (Arrays,Collections,XML Docs,  Databases etc..)

Basic ways to write LINQ query to enumerate a collection or any data source

 Query Syntax/expressions : starts with a key word from and ends with either select or group by
 Method Syntax/Fluent/Method Extensions : uses extension methods like where, find, order by
    
LINQ queries return results as objects

from <range variable> in IEnumerable<T> or IQueryable<T> collection
<standard query operator> <lambda expressions>
<select or group operator><result formation>
